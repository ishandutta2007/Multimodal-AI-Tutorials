# Multimodal AI Tutorial

## Introduction
Welcome to the Multimodal AI Tutorial! This guide is designed to introduce you to the fascinating and rapidly evolving field of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence. Multimodal AI focuses on building AI systems that can process and understand information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video, much like humans do.

In this tutorial, we will explore the core concepts, techniques, and applications of Multimodal AI. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced practitioner seeking to deepen your knowledge, this resource aims to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights into developing intelligent systems that can perceive and interact with the world in a more holistic way.

Let's embark on this exciting journey to unlock the potential of AI that speaks, sees, and understands!
