# Chapter 2: Why Multimodal AI?
The motivation behind Multimodal AI stems from several key advantages and the limitations of unimodal (single-modality) AI systems:

*   **Richer Understanding:** Real-world phenomena are inherently multimodal. Relying on a single modality often provides an incomplete picture. Combining information from multiple sources leads to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the environment or context.
*   **Robustness to Noise and Ambiguity:** If one modality is noisy, incomplete, or ambiguous, other modalities can compensate. For instance, in a noisy environment, lip-reading (visual) can aid speech recognition (audio).
*   **Improved Performance:** Integrating diverse information often leads to better performance in various tasks, such as sentiment analysis (text + facial expressions), image captioning (image + text generation), and autonomous driving (vision + radar + lidar).
*   **Human-like Intelligence:** Humans naturally process multimodal information. Developing AI that mimics this capability brings us closer to achieving more general and human-like artificial intelligence.
*   **Broader Applications:** Multimodal AI opens up new possibilities for applications that were previously challenging or impossible with unimodal approaches, including advanced human-computer interaction, medical diagnosis, content generation, and robotics.
*   **Bridging Modality Gaps:** It allows for tasks like generating text from images (image captioning) or images from text (text-to-image synthesis), effectively bridging the gap between different data types.
